# opx-db-sql
This repository contains the opx-db-sql wrapper to db-sql API used for the virtual machine (VM) target.

VM presents an abstraction of the hardware (thermal sensors, fans, LEDs, optics, interfaces, and so on) in a VM environment. SDI VM's sole client is the PAS, similarly, the SAI VM client is the NAS and it queries the devices using the API defined in the sdi-api and functionality in the sai-api.
